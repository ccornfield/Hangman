# Hangman - A portfolio project.

Welcome to my code institute milestone project. This is my second of such projects. For this milestone project, I was tasked with creating a webpage that was not only interactive but also offered some form of service, most often in the form of a game. In order to meet this goal, I decided to create a simple game of hangman featuring a robot rather than the typical figure. I chose to do this due to its simplicity and the potential for imagery unique to my site.

# Planning & Development #

### Business Strategy

When deciding on the game I was going to make I had already decided on making a word game. This was due to my relative confidence in working with arrays and their lasting popularity combined with the relative ease that they can be put together allowing for a reasonably quick completion time. It was also chosen due to it's prevalence in many major demographics.

### Target Audience

Like in my previous project I was not originally going into this with a market to aim for, not because it was a mock for anything; It was a serious project for showcasing my design and coding ability. It was moreso due to the knowledge that a game such as this did not need extensive marketing since it was a self-contained effort that served more like a sandbox than anything else. That being said it's important to understand it's potential reach in the event that such a concept needs be executed again in a more professional environment.

My research shows that 79% of people that search for hangman on facebook while the most popular age group featured on the website were those aged 65+ which accounted for 29% of all searches showing that the main market for hangman is older women, possibly retired.

### Seafood Keyword Search

* 29% Female demographic
* 65+ age range

Considering these parameters, while mobile will of course need to be considered and ensured that it is responsive in its design, due to the age range present a heavy focus on effective desktop design will also be a nessecity. Clear and simple controls with an uncluttered UI and a large, readable font will be essential in making the website as easy to use for older persons as possible.

### User Needs

#### User Stories
1. Be able to enter their username
2. Capeable of suggesting letters to the submission box
3. Booking their meals in advance to reserve a table.
